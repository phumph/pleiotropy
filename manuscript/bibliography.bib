	Abstract = {Growth rate is increasingly recognized as a key life-history trait that may affect fitness directly rather than evolve as a by-product of selection on size or age. An ongoing challenge is to explain the abundant levels of phenotypic and genetic variation in growth rates often seen in natural populations, despite what is expected to be consistently strong selection on this trait. Such a paradox suggests limits to how contemporary growth rates evolve. We explored limits arising from variation in selection, based on selection differentials for age-specific growth rates expressed under different ecological conditions. We present results from a field experiment that measured growth rates and reproductive output in wild individuals of a colonial marine invertebrate (Hippopodina iririkiensis), replicated within and across the natural range of succession in its local community. Colony growth rates varied phenotypically throughout this range, but not all such variation was available for selection, nor was it always targeted by selection as expected. While the maintenance of both phenotypic and genetic variation in growth rate is often attributed to costs of growing rapidly, our study highlights the potential for fluctuating selection pressures throughout the life history and across environments to play an important role in this process.},

@article{Chevin10a,
	Abstract = {Genetic theories of adaptation generally overlook the genes in which beneficial substitutions occur, and the likely variation in their mutational effects. We investigate the consequences of heterogeneous mutational effects among loci on the genetics of adaptation. We use a generalization of Fisher's geometrical model, which assumes multivariate Gaussian stabilizing selection on multiple characters. In our model, mutation has a distinct variance-covariance matrix of phenotypic effects for each locus. Consequently, the distribution of selection coefficients s varies across loci. We assume each locus can only affect a limited number of independent linear combinations of phenotypic traits (restricted pleiotropy), which differ among loci, an effect we term "orientation heterogeneity." Restricted pleiotropy can sharply reduce the overall proportion of beneficial mutations. Orientation heterogeneity has little impact on the shape of the genomic distribution, but can substantially increase the probability of parallel evolution (the repeated fixation of beneficial mutations at the same gene in independent populations), which is highest with low pleiotropy. We also consider variation in the degree of pleiotropy and in the mean s across loci. The latter impacts the genomic distribution of s, but has a much milder effect on parallel evolution. We discuss these results in the light of evolution experiments.},

@article{Schoustra10a,
	Abstract = {Sex is a long-standing evolutionary enigma. Although the majority of eukaryotes reproduce sexually at least sometimes [1-3], the evolution of sex from an asexual ancestor has been difficult to explain because it requires sexually reproducing lineages to overcome the manifold costs of sex, including the destruction of favorable gene combinations created by selection [4, 5]. Conditions for the evolution of sex are much broader if individuals can reproduce either sexually or asexually (i.e., facultative sex) and allocate disproportionately more resources to sex when their fitness is low (fitness-associated-sex or FAS [6-10]). Although facultatively sexual organisms have been shown to engage in more sex when stressed [11], direct evidence for FAS is lacking. We provide evidence using 53 genotypes of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans in a reciprocal transplant experiment across three environments. Different genotypes achieved highest fitness in different environments and genotypes invested relatively more in sex in environments in which their fitness was lower, showing that allocation to sexual reproduction is a function of how well-adapted a genotype is to its environment. FAS in A. nidulans is unlikely to have evolved as a strategy to resist or avoid stress because asexual spores are more dispersive and equally resistant [12, 13].},

@article{Schoustra09a,
	Abstract = {The rarity of beneficial mutations has frustrated efforts to develop a quantitative theory of adaptation. Recent models of adaptive walks, the sequential substitution of beneficial mutations by selection, make two compelling predictions: adaptive walks should be short, and fitness increases should become exponentially smaller as successive mutations fix. We estimated the number and fitness effects of beneficial mutations in each of 118 replicate lineages of Aspergillus nidulans evolving for approximately 800 generations at two population sizes using a novel maximum likelihood framework, the results of which were confirmed experimentally using sexual crosses. We find that adaptive walks do indeed tend to be short, and fitness increases become smaller as successive mutations fix. Moreover, we show that these patterns are associated with a decreasing supply of beneficial mutations as the population adapts. We also provide empirical distributions of fitness effects among mutations fixed at each step. Our results provide a first glimpse into the properties of multiple steps in an adaptive walk in asexual populations and lend empirical support to models of adaptation involving selection towards a single optimum phenotype. In practical terms, our results suggest that the bulk of adaptation is likely to be accomplished within the first few steps.},

These studies highlight the importance of environmental structure in governing the fate of diversity and shed light on the genetic mechanisms generating diversity. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of placing detailed molecular-level studies within the context of a sound ecological and evolutionary framework.},

@article{Kassen04a,
	Abstract = {Taxonomic diversification commonly occurs through adaptive radiation, the rapid evolution of a single lineage into a range of genotypes or species each adapted to a different ecological niche. Radiation size (measured as the number of new types) varies widely between phylogenetically distinct taxa and between replicate radiations within a single taxon where the ecological opportunities available seem to be identical. Here we show how variation in energy input (productivity) and environmental disturbance combine to determine the extent of diversification in a single radiating lineage of Pseudomonas fluorescens adapting to laboratory conditions. Diversity peaked at intermediate rates of both productivity and disturbance and declined towards the extremes in a manner reminiscent of well-known ecological patterns. The mechanism responsible for the decrease in diversity arises from pleiotropic fitness costs associated with niche specialization, the effects of which are modulated by gradients of productivity and disturbance. Our results indicate that ecological gradients may constrain the size of adaptive radiations, even in the presence of the strong diversifying selection associated with ecological opportunity, by decoupling evolutionary diversification from ecological coexistence.},

	Abstract = {Environmental variance can be decomposed into two components: the contrast among patches in the optimal phenotype and the variance in productivity among patches. Both components can influence the outcome of selection in heterogeneous environments. In general genetic diversity within a population should increase as the contrast among patches increases. As the variance in productivity increases, on the other hand, individual niche breadth should decrease since the response to selection becomes dominated by adaptation to the most productive patch. We tested this interpretation of diversity in heterogeneous environments by selecting the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens over several hundred generations in pair-wise mixtures of four carbon substrates. We then assessed the response to selection in the mixtures in terms of performance on each component substrate. The results provide general support for this interpretation of the environmental variance and suggest further that competition among genotypes promotes diversification in heterogeneous environments.},

	Abstract = {The pattern (space versus time) and scale (relative to the lifetime of individuals) of environmental variation is thought to play a central role in governing the evolution of the ecological niche and the maintenance of genetic variance in fitness. To evaluate this idea, we serially propagated an initially genetically uniform population of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens for a few hundred generations in environments that differed in both the pattern and scale at which two highly contrasted carbon substrates were experienced. We found that, contrary to expectations, populations often evolved into a single niche specialist adapted to the less-productive substrate in variable environments and that the genetic variance in fitness across different components of the environment was not generally higher in variable environments when compared with constant environments. We provide evidence to suggest that our results reflect a novel constraint on niche evolution imposed by the supply of beneficial mutations available to selection in variable environments.},

	Abstract = {The history of life has been punctuated by unusually spectacular periods of evolutionary diversification called adaptive radiation. Darwin's finches in the Galapagos, cichlid fishes in African Rift and Nicaraguan crater lakes, and the emergence of mammals at the end of the Cretaceous are hallmark examples. Although we have learned much from these and other case studies about the mechanisms thought to drive adaptive radiations, convincing experimental tests of theory are often lacking for the simple reason that it is usually impossible to "rewind the tape of life," as Stephen Jay Gould was fond of saying, and run it again. This situation has changed dramatically in recent years with the increasing emphasis on the use of microbial populations which, because of their small size and rapid generation times, make possible the construction of replicated, manipulative experiments to study evolution in the laboratory. Here I review the contributions that microbial experimental evolution has made to our understanding of the ecological and genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive radiation. I focus on three major gaps in the theory of adaptive radiation--the paucity of direct tests of mechanism, the genetics of diversification, and the limits and constraints on the progress of radiations--with the aim of pointing the way toward the development of a more general theory of adaptive radiation.},

	Abstract = {The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogens is a major impediment to the control of microbial disease. Here, we review mechanisms of quinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important nosocomial pathogen and a major cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In this quantitative literature review, we find that mutations in DNA gyrase A, the primary target of quinolones in Gram-negative bacteria, are the most common resistance mutations identified in clinical samples of all origins, in keeping with previous observations. However, the identities of non-gyrase resistance mutations vary systematically between samples isolated from CF patients and those isolated from acute infections. CF-derived strains tend to harbour mutations in the efflux pump regulator nfxB, while non-CF strains tend to bear mutations in the efflux regulator mexR or in parC, which encodes one of two subunits of DNA topoisomerase IV. We suggest that differences in resistance mechanisms between CF and non-CF strains result either from local adaptation to different sites of infection or from differences in mutational processes between different environments. We further discuss the therapeutic implications of local differentiation in resistance mechanisms to a common antibiotic.},

	Abstract = {Adaptations are constructed through the sequential substitution of beneficial mutations by natural selection. However, the rarity of beneficial mutations has precluded efforts to describe even their most basic properties. Do beneficial mutations typically confer small or large fitness gains? Are their fitness effects environment specific, or are they broadly beneficial across a range of environments? To answer these questions, we used two subsets (n = 18 and n = 63) of a large library of mutants carrying antibiotic resistance mutations in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens whose fitness, along with the antibiotic sensitive ancestor, was assayed across 95 novel environments differing in the carbon source available for growth. We explore patterns of genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions and ecological specialization among the 18 mutants initially found superior to the sensitive ancestor in one environment. We find that G × E is remarkably similar between the two sets of mutants and that beneficial mutants are not typically associated with large costs of adaptation. Fitness effects among beneficial mutants depart from a strict exponential distribution: they assume a variety of shapes that are often roughly L shaped but always right truncated. Distributions of (beneficial) fitness effects predicted by a landscape model assuming multiple traits underlying fitness and a single optimum often provide a good description of the empirical distributions in our data. Simulations of data sets containing a mixture of single and double mutants under this landscape show that inferences about the distribution of fitness effects of beneficial mutants is quite robust to contamination by second-site mutations.},

	Abstract = {The repeatability of adaptive evolution depends on the ruggedness of the underlying adaptive landscape. We contrasted the relative ruggedness of two adaptive landscapes by measuring the variance in fitness and metabolic phenotype within and among genetically distinct strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens in two environments differing only in the carbon source provided (glucose vs. xylose). Fitness increased in all lines, plateauing in one environment but not the other. The pattern of variance in fitness among replicate lines was unique to the selection environment; it increased over the course of the experiment in xylose but not in glucose. Metabolic phenotypes displayed two results: (1) populations adapted via changes that were distinctive to their selection environment, and (2) endpoint phenotypes were less variable in glucose than in xylose. These results indicate that although the response to selection is highly repeatable at the level of fitness, the underlying genetic routes taken were different for each environment and more variable in xylose. We suggest that this reflects a more rugged adaptive landscape in xylose compared to glucose. Our study demonstrates the utility of using replicate selection lines with different evolutionary starting points to try and quantify the relative ruggedness of adaptive landscapes.},

	Abstract = {Abundant ecological opportunity is thought to drive adaptation and diversification. The presence of multiple opportunities leads to divergent selection, which can slow adaptation when niche-specific beneficial mutations have antagonistically pleiotropic effects. Alternately, competition for multiple opportunities can generate divergent selection, which leads to high rates of adaptive differentiation. Which outcome occurs may depend on the spatial structure of those ecological opportunities. In a mixture of resources, competition for multiple opportunities can drive divergent selection; however, if each resource is available in a spatially distinct patch, simultaneous competition for multiple opportunities cannot occur. We report the effects of the extent and spatial structure of ecological opportunity on the evolutionary dynamics of populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens over 1,000 generations. We varied the extent of ecological opportunity by varying the number of sugar resources (mannose, glucose, and xylose), and we varied spatial structure by providing resources in either mixtures or spatially distinct patches. We saw that a particularly novel resource (xylose) drove the rate of adaptation when provided in a mixture but had no effect on diversity. Instead, we saw the evolution of a single adaptive strategy that differed with respect to phenotype and degree of specialization, depending on both the extent and the spatial structure of ecological opportunity.},

@article{Wong12a,
	Abstract = {Adaptation is likely to be an important determinant of the success of many pathogens, for example when colonizing a new host species, when challenged by antibiotic treatment, or in governing the establishment and progress of long-term chronic infection. Yet, the genomic basis of adaptation is poorly understood in general, and for pathogens in particular. We investigated the genetics of adaptation to cystic fibrosis-like culture conditions in the presence and absence of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whole-genome sequencing of experimentally evolved isolates revealed parallel evolution at a handful of known antibiotic resistance genes. While the level of antibiotic resistance was largely determined by these known resistance genes, the costs of resistance were instead attributable to a number of mutations that were specific to individual experimental isolates. Notably, stereotypical quinolone resistance mutations in DNA gyrase often co-occurred with other mutations that, together, conferred high levels of resistance but no consistent cost of resistance. This result may explain why these mutations are so prevalent in clinical quinolone-resistant isolates. In addition, genes involved in cyclic-di-GMP signalling were repeatedly mutated in populations evolved in viscous culture media, suggesting a shared mechanism of adaptation to this CF-like growth environment. Experimental evolutionary approaches to understanding pathogen adaptation should provide an important complement to studies of the evolution of clinical isolates.},

Mutations are the ultimate source of new alleles, yet there have been few experimental investigations of the role of novel mutations in multivariate phenotypic evolution. Here, we evaluated the degree of multivariate phenotypic divergence observed in a long-term evolution experiment whereby replicate lineages of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans were derived from a single genotype and allowed to fix novel (beneficial) mutations while maintained at two different population sizes. We asked three fundamental questions regarding phenotypic divergence following approximately 800 generations of adaptation: (1) whether divergence was limited by mutational supply, (2) whether divergence proceeded in relatively many (few) multivariate directions, and (3) to what degree phenotypic divergence scaled with changes in fitness (i.e. adaptation). We found no evidence that mutational supply limited phenotypic divergence. Divergence also occurred in all possible phenotypic directions, implying that pleiotropy was either weak or sufficiently variable among new mutations so as not to constrain the direction of multivariate evolution. The degree of total phenotypic divergence from the common ancestor was positively correlated with the extent of adaptation. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution of complex phenotypes through the input of adaptive mutations.},

	Abstract = {Competitors are known to be important in governing the outcome of evolutionary diversification during an adaptive radiation, but the precise mechanisms by which they exert their effects remain elusive. Using the model adaptive radiation of Pseudomonas fluorescens, we show experimentally that the effect of competition on diversification of a focal lineage depends on both the strength of competition and the ability of the competitors to diversify. We provide evidence that the extent of diversification in the absence of interspecific competitors depends on the strength of resource competition. We also show that the presence of competitors can actually increase diversity by increasing interspecific resource competition. Competitors that themselves are able to diversify prevent diversification of the focal lineage by removing otherwise available ecological opportunities. These results suggest that the progress of an adaptive radiation depends ultimately on the strength of resource competition, an effect that can be exaggerated or impeded by the presence of competitors.},

	Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that synonymous mutations, nucleotide changes that do not alter the encoded amino acid, have no detectable effect on phenotype or fitness. However, a growing body of evidence from both comparative and experimental studies suggests otherwise. Synonymous mutations have been shown to impact gene expression, protein folding and fitness, however, direct evidence that they can be positively selected, and so contribute to adaptation, is lacking. Here we report the recovery of two beneficial synonymous single base pair changes that arose spontaneously and independently in an experimentally evolved population of Pseudomonas fluorescens. We show experimentally that these mutations increase fitness by an amount comparable to non-synonymous mutations and that the fitness increases stem from increased gene expression. These results provide unequivocal evidence that synonymous mutations can drive adaptive evolution and suggest that this class of mutation may be underappreciated as a cause of adaptation and evolutionary dynamics.},

@article{Kraemer15a,
	Abstract = {Our understanding of microbial biogeography has been governed by the dictum "Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects." In other words, the distribution of microbes is thought to occur in a regime of extensive dispersal and strong selection, generating local adaptation. However, direct tests of these assumptions are rare. Here, we investigate the extent of local adaptation in space and time of a collection of soil-derived microbial isolates, most belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, across a growing season from a deciduous forest in western Quebec, Canada, using a reciprocal transplant design. Average performance of all clones varied substantially in both space and time, in line with the expectation of strong selection in both dimensions. The behavior of genotype-by-environment variance in fitness and its components, responsiveness and inconsistency, in space and through time suggests that the strength of divergent selection increases as sites become more distant from each other in both dimensions. However, divergent selection was not strong enough to maintain different specialized types across the environments studied, which suggests that Pseudomonas and their close relatives are not locally adapted to the prevailing conditions of growth.},

@article{Bailey15a,
	Abstract = {Across the great diversity of life, there are many compelling examples of parallel and convergent evolution-similar evolutionary changes arising in independently evolving populations. Parallel evolution is often taken to be strong evidence of adaptation occurring in populations that are highly constrained in their genetic variation. Theoretical models suggest a few potential factors driving the probability of parallel evolution, but experimental tests are needed. In this study, we quantify the degree of parallel evolution in 15 replicate populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens evolved in five different environments that varied in resource type and arrangement. We identified repeat changes across multiple levels of biological organization from phenotype, to gene, to nucleotide, and tested the impact of 1) selection environment, 2) the degree of adaptation, and 3) the degree of heterogeneity in the environment on the degree of parallel evolution at the gene-level. We saw, as expected, that parallel evolution occurred more often between populations evolved in the same environment; however, the extent of parallel evolution varied widely. The degree of adaptation did not significantly explain variation in the extent of parallelism in our system but number of available beneficial mutations correlated negatively with parallel evolution. In addition, degree of parallel evolution was significantly higher in populations evolved in a spatially structured, multiresource environment, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity may be an important factor constraining adaptation. Overall, our results stress the importance of environment in driving parallel evolutionary changes and point to a number of avenues for future work for understanding when evolution is predictable.},

@article{Melnyk15a,
	Abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is increasing in pathogenic microbial populations and is thus a major threat to public health. The fate of a resistance mutation in pathogen populations is determined in part by its fitness. Mutations that suffer little or no fitness cost are more likely to persist in the absence of antibiotic treatment. In this review, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the fitness costs associated with single mutational events that confer resistance. Generally, these mutations were costly, although several drug classes and species of bacteria on average did not show a cost. Further investigations into the rate and fitness values of compensatory mutations that alleviate the costs of resistance will help us to better understand both the emergence and management of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings.},

@article{Schick15a,
	Abstract = {Local adaptation seems to be common in natural systems, but the genetic causes of its evolution remain poorly understood. Here we characterize the genetic causes of trade-offs generating local adaptation in populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens that had previously been evolved for specialization on three different carbon resources. We measured the fitness effects of mutations that arose during selection in that environment and in alternative environments to quantify the degree of specialization. We find that all mutations are beneficial in the environment of selection and that those arising later during adaptation are associated with increasingly antagonistic effects in alternative environments compared with those arising earlier, consistent with a multioptima version of Fisher's geometric model of adaptation. We also find that fitness of pairs of beneficial mutations are consistently less than additive in selection environments, producing a pattern of diminishing returns, but are more variable in alternative environments, being either positive or negative. Finally, we find that mutations in genes associated with loss of motility are beneficial across all environments, whereas mutations involving other functions, such as gene regulation, had more variable effects, being more environment specific. Taken together, these results provide a detailed account of the genetics of specialization and suggest that the evolution of trade-offs associated with local adaptation may often result from the antagonistic effects of beneficial mutations substituted later in adaptation.},
